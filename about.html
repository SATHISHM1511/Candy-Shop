        <h1>ABOUT us</h1>
        <h2>Step inside the world’s largest food and beverage company</h2>
        <P>Good food nourishes and delights the senses. It helps pets to thrive, children to grow healthily and parents to age gracefully. It helps all of us to live life to the fullest. Good food also respects our planet and protects resources for future generations.

            But times are changing fast. And we know that what’s good today won’t be good enough tomorrow. Consider the challenge of satisfying the needs of 10 billion people by 2050 in a responsible and sustainable way. This will demand innovation and change.
            
            At Nestlé, we’re constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with food, drink and nutritional health solutions. That way we can enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future for all.
            
            Today, our business has around 275,000 employees, more than 2,000 brands and a presence in 188 countries.</P>
